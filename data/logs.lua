I changed the name of "Curio Shop" to "Barnabus" before the first commit. Both
names are inspired by Teraum, specifically a store formerly run by Barnabus
Trent, which sold items from around the world to people in Bellybrush and
Ack. The notion being, those items were stripped of context, reduced to little
bits of curiosity. That's true of the data being presented here as
clobbered-together HTML. But! Made the first commit: I have something that can
read some Lua data and make an HTML file. Wonderful.]]}
