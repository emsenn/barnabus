I think **_tarot readings_** can be a wonderful problem-solving tool,
regardless of the beliefs of anyone involved: they're a great way for
_framing a question in a unique way_.

I've structured my tarot readings like my other consultation sessions:
you can click the button below to fill out a short form to apply. If
my service seems like a good fit, we can schedule your session.
Otherwise, I'll try to refer you to more useful information.

Generally, I consider a tarot reading to be most useful when you
_feel_ like you're struggling with something, but can't seem to
_think_ clearly about the problem.

If I accept you for a session, it'll take 30 to 40 minutes. We'll meet
through an online video conference, but you don't have to use your
microphone or video if you don't want. Afterward, you'll get a brief
reporting on the cards that were drawn, and a recording of the
session.
