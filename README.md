# Barnabus
*emsenn's website generator*

**Lua tables -> *(Barnabus + Mustache)* -> HTML**

***Barnabus*** is a hack to present Lua data as an HTML document.
It's implemented in [Fennel][fennel].


It's a way of taking [my][emsenn] archive of writing and stuff and making it
available as a simple website, while also making the data more readily-accessible
going forward.
